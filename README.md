# Map-ADT
The map ADT contains a collection of key-value pairs. This project represents a map using as a doubly linked list, containing the following operations that can be applied to this data structure: adding a key-value pair, searching/deleting a value according to its key, displaying the elements in the container and checking if it is empty.

The structure is completed by an iterator that facilitates traversing the container to perform operations. 

The pairs in the list are defined as "TElem" type, and the keys and values are "TKey", respectively, "TValue". Also, each node of the list contains the information regarding the key, the value and two pointers for the previous and the next element of the list. 

Above the implementation, the operations have explanations for the complexities of the algorithms.
